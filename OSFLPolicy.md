## OSFL Policy

This will be a work in progress. I hope to collect and share some of my experiences with running a Front Office Football Seven league at [The OSFL](http://www.simgamingnetwork.com/forums/index.php). 

Running a league is an endeavor that takes care. Much credit goes from watching how previous admins aholbert, Lintyfresh85, and BradZ operated, as well as how bode and Firefly have run [The CyFL](http://cyberfootballleague.com/forums/forum.php). These guys set the standard.

## House Rules
My preference is to leave the game in as native an experience as possible. In a few cases, we've adopted house rules and I'll try to explain them here.

#### Trades
Exceptions to in-game warnings: I run trades at any point in the offseason (including before FA begins). The in-season deadline is Week 8. I won't allow recently signed free agents to be traded, unless that player is a drafted rookie.

The game also won't allow more than 5 trade items to be entered on one side. It's possible to trade additional items for nothing, but I use this limit as a line. If a trade can be plausibly split up into two trades, that's fine. Otherwise, find a way to keep it under 5.

In some cases, I'll ask a GM for extra confirmation, if they missed a detail. Otherwise, I prefer to stay away from intervening and stopping a trade. Trading in nature is a lopsided area of the game. It's up to owners to take their risks.

#### Drafting
I prefer a very strict policy of not rolling back the draft, unless it's a technical issue on our end.

#### Free Agency
I've gathered a general consensus that no rules free agency (as of one of the post-release updates to FOF7, which fixed a valuation bug) works very well in conjunction with disallowing the franchise tag.

We tend to prefer having the tag in the OSFL, so we've adopted a blend of common rules. 1-year contracts for unrestricted FAs are fine, *but* those players may not be tagged the following offseason.

The issue otherwise is that it's possible to use spare cap in one year to overwhelm the competition to land a player, and then keep that player indefinitely without competition, and at standard (non-FA) market value thereafter via the franchsie tag.
